primes_and_factors
==================

just a bit of code for my 9yo son, to show about factors and primes and simplifying fractions

node.js javascript code that computes :
- factors [ empty if prime, or with prime factors is nonprime, with multiplicities ]
- simplify a fraction N/D, by factorising N and D and then taking out the common factors
- runs thru say the first 1000 integers and computes their factors


We ran this, seems ok to factorise and gather primes for N from 1 to a million, takes 15 minutes or so, not optimised.
