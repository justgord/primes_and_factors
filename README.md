primes_and_factors
==================

Just a bit of code for my 9yo son, to show about factors and primes and simplifying fractions

This is javascript code for node.js [or browser] that computes :
- array of factors [ empty if prime, or prime factors if composite, with multiplicities ]
- simplify a fraction N/D, by factorising N and D and then taking out the common factors
- runs thru say the first 1000 integers and computes their factors


We ran this, seems ok to factorise and gather primes for N from 1 to 1000000,
although takes several minutes, not optimised.
